I am writing a report for the Coventry city council in the UK on their future climate change risks. I need you to write a summary of the exposure and senstivity for a specfic risk. Exposure is defined as the degree to which a system is exposed. Senstivity is defined as Degree to which a system is affected. An example of this summary is for the risk -Risks to health and wellbeing from high temperatures - The exposure is summarised as -There is a high % of people in vulnerable groups (infants, elderly and unwell) in the city that will be exposed to high temperatures- The sensitivty is summarised as -Vulnerable groups are very sensitive to extreme heat events. Extreme heat can result in increased health stress and in some instances, death. -.
